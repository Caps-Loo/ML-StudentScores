Student Scores Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Background Problem
In this project, the goal is to predict student exam scores based on the number of hours studied using machine learning models. Understanding the relationship between study hours and performance can help in identifying students who may need additional support or tutoring. By building a predictive model, the task is to predict exam scores based on the amount of study time, leveraging historical student data.

This project uses a simple dataset containing hours studied and exam scores, often used for beginner-level regression tasks. The dataset can be accessed directly via Kaggle, or you can use any similar dataset.

Libraries & Version
This project uses the following libraries:

pandas v1.3.0 – for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy v1.21.0 – for numerical operations.
seaborn v0.11.1 – for data visualization.
scikit-learn v0.24 – for machine learning models and tools.
matplotlib v3.4.2 – for visualizations.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the number of hours studied and the corresponding exam scores of students. It is a simple dataset used for regression tasks to predict continuous values (scores) based on an input feature (study hours).

Project Steps
Import Libraries and Read Dataset: Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data exploration, checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Split the data into training and testing sets, and apply feature scaling to standardize the data.
Modeling: Train multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²).
Visualization: Visualize the results with scatter plots, box plots, and performance comparison charts.
Insights
Key insights from this project include:

Best Model: Random Forest was the best-performing model based on the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and highest R-squared (R²) value, providing accurate predictions for student scores.
Model Performance Comparison: Linear Regression performed well as a simple and interpretable model, while Decision Tree showed decent performance but was less accurate than other models.
Feature Scaling Impact: Scaling the features improved model performance by standardizing the data, making it easier for the models to train.
R-squared Insights: All models showed good ability to explain the variance in student scores, with Random Forest achieving the best results.
Advice
This project can be further developed in the following areas:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Tuning hyperparameters for models like Random Forest or Decision Tree (e.g., adjusting n_estimators or max_depth) could improve performance.
Additional Features: Including other features such as class participation, previous grades, or study environment might enhance the accuracy of the predictions.
Advanced Models: Experimenting with neural networks or ensemble learning techniques could improve predictive power, especially if more complex relationships are present in the data.
Conclusion
In this project, we built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict student exam scores based on study hours. The results show that Random Forest is the best model for this task, though Linear Regression provides a good alternative for simpler predictions. The project emphasizes the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature scaling in preparing data for effective model training.
